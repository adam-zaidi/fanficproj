    The DreamSMP was a private Minecraft multiplayer server created by Minecraft content creators Dream and GeorgeNotFound. Originally created as a simple way to play the vanilla version of Minecraft, it soon morphed into a roleplay server, where dozens of different players and content creators played fictionalized versions of themselves in a loosely structured storyline. Their stories revolved around a series of conflicts between rival factions and players, battling for control of land and different magical items. Overtime, players created niches for themselves, spawning a host of protagonists and antagonists, each with their own unique personalities and backstories. Due to a lack of a set storyline, much of the drama in the series came from improvisation and the genuine personalities of the players, lending the series a sense of authenticity. In addition, the server's unique approach to storytelling—where viewers could switch between different streamers' perspectives to get various angles of the unfolding drama—revolutionized how stories could be told in the gaming space. This method allowed the audience to become, in a sense, directors of their own viewing experience, piecing together the narrative from multiple viewpoints. Being a private server, each member was handpicked by Dream to play a role in the server's story, creating a tight-knit community of players that complimented each others personalities.

    </br>
    Due to Minecraft's young player base, the Dream SMP quickly drew in a large number of fans across the internet, quickly becoming a worldwide phenomenon, and launching many smaller creators to big time successes. Soon after the rise in popularity, fanfiction and fan art of Dream SMP characters began to spread across the internet, and the server became a source of inspiration for fan-made content. Much of this fan-made content focused on the characters' personalities, backstories, and relationships with each other, as well as the server's lore. Much of the fanfiction written focused on the interpersonal relationships, particularly between Dream and GeorgeNotFound, who played a very amicable and caring friendship on the DreamSMP. This echoes the male slash fiction often found in fandoms, with Dream/GeorgeNotFound topping the slash charts of the fanfiction website Archive of our Own (AO3). Due to the young age of the creators on the Dream SMP, sexual content depicting these underage characters became a hot-button issue on the server, with creators urging fans to avoid sexualizing minors.

  <p>
    While Minecraft has always been a part of internet culture over the past decade and a half, directly prior to the pandemic, Minecraft was in a bit of a lull. Being extremely popular on Youtube and other social media in the early 2010s, its popularity began to decline as content became stale, and it seemed like every avenue of the game had been explored. While a large audience still remained for Minecraft content, it was clear that it might not ever reach its peak in 2013. As creators began to feel the limits of the block game, they started pushing boundaries, and exploring new ways to play the game. This includes a variety of multiplayer mini-game servers, and extravagant mods that completely changed how the game was played.
</br>
</br>
    As the 2010s came to a close, Minecraft started to have a small rennaisance. In particular, one creator by the username Dream quickly rose to fame in late 2019, due to the creative ways he harnessed the game's vanilla mechanics to create new content. Along with his friend GeorgeNotFound, they would code datapacks that used the game's built-in mechanics to create new ideas and challenges, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqG9ujWY54E">"Minecraft, But Mobs Double Every Minute..."</a>. Along with the creativity displayed by Dream, audiences were quickly drawn in by the personalities of Dream and GeorgeNotFound, as they provided comedic relief to what would otherwise be videos about difficult Minecraft challenges. This brand of simplicity and authenticity was quickly recognized by the internet, and Dream and GeorgeNotFound quickly became some of the most popular Minecraft content creators at the time. This focus on the characters and their personalities was a key factor in their success, which would soon be replicated in the Dream SMP.

  <h3 id="pandemic">2020 COVID-19 Pandemic</h3>
  <p>
    With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, hordes of people were thrust indoors, forced to stay home. The internet became a vital source of socializing and community, in a time where many people were fragmented. In this environment, Minecraft's rennaisance grew even larger, as the game's community exponentially. Many large online creators would regularly play Minecraft in Youtube videos and on livestream, such as XQCow, Ryan Higa, and James Charles. With the start of the Dream SMP in April of 2020, millions of Dream fans would tune in to livestreams on the livestreaming platform Twitch, and watch their favorite Youtubers play with each other. As time went on and the storylines of the Dream SMP became more and more complex, streamers would regularly get hundreds of thousands of concurrent viewers tuned in to see the latest development. With more people online and looking for ways to connect and escape the monotony of lockdown, the server provided a community and a story to be part of. The live nature of the content, combined with the accessibility of platforms like Twitch and YouTube, allowed viewers from around the world to tune in and become part of a shared experience. At any given time, viewers could find multiple creators livestreaming the server, doing a variety of different activities, from canon lore events to creating beautiful artwork to pulling pranks on each other.

  <figure class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><a class="mw-file-description"><img src="images/dsmprelationship-chart.jpg" decoding="async" width="500px" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="700" data-file-height="400"></a><figcaption>A chart mapping all of the relationships between Dream SMP members</figcaption></figure>
    <p>
      The storylines of the Dream SMP are vast and varied, often involving the creation, rise, and fall of nations, intricate political power, and deep personal stories of betrayal, friendship, and rivalry. One of the earliest and most notable story arcs is the conflict between the server's original members and the newly formed nation of L'Manburg, which sought independence from the greater SMP. This conflict led to several wars, with the first major one aptly named the "L'Manberg Independence War," which concluded with L'Manberg gaining its independence, albeit at great cost. This arc was self-described as a reference to Hamilton, with many of the characters referencing the events of the play. Dream, the creator himself, took on a pivotal role within the server's extensive narratives, often portraying a complex antagonist that added depth and intrigue to the storylines. His character, while sharing his name, diverged from his real-life persona, embodying the nuances of a villain whose actions and motivations were central to the unfolding drama within the server. Dream's portrayal as a villain was nuanced, often blurring the lines between villainy and a more complex, morally grey character. His actions, while antagonistic, added layers to the server's narrative, creating conflicts that drove the story forward and elicited strong emotional responses from both the characters within the server and the audience watching. Often his true goofy nature would bleed into the character's personality, giving levity to what would otherwise be very self-indulgent roleplay.

  </br>
  </br>
  At the heart of the Dream SMP was its improvisational nature. While certain plot points and events were planned, much of the storytelling unfolded live, with players reacting in real-time to developments. This approach allowed for authentic emotional reactions and spontaneous moments that resonated with viewers. The blend of planned story arcs with on-the-fly role-playing created a dynamic narrative environment, where even the participants were unsure of what might happen next. Many of the most notable one liners/moments that would later be featured in fanart and stories was simply from an off the cuff remark by a player. In addition, the Dream SMP brilliantly integrated Minecraft's game mechanics into its storytelling. The use of in-game items like TommyInnit's music discs or the construction and destruction of significant landmarks like L'Manburg added a tangible aspect to narrative that was otherwise pretty detached from the normal progression of the game. In a story full of complex personalities and interweaving stories These elements grounded it in the game's world, making the server's events feel consequential and immersive. At the end of the Retribution Arc, the character Technoblade unleashes an arsenal of withers, hostile mobs that completely destroy the majority of the landmarks the viewers had come to know and love. The buildings that creators had spent hundreds of hours building and viewers had spent hundreds of hours watching were razed, creating a real sense of stakes.

    As mentioned, there were many factors that came together to create the perfect storm that elevated the Dream SMP to Minecraft and internet fame. The COVID-19 pandemic drove millions of viewers to the server, and in return the members of the server provided thousands of hours of content for the audience to watch at the drop of a hat. With streamers from all over the globe, at its peak it was virtually assured that at least one of the members was streaming at any given point.

  <h3>SAD-ist and Animatics</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most prominent artists to arise from the DreamSMP fandom is SAD-ist. SAD-ist posted their first video related to the Dream SMP in June of 2020, which while not about the Dream SMP, featured several of its characters from a separate Youtube video. This video, entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QaKl4zAQT0">'Who's who?' | DreamTeam+BBH/Muffinteers (Animation)"</a>, featured an animation of a scene from a youtube video by Dream using the original audio. In subsequent videos, SAD-ist would use the style of animatics, which is a style of storyboarding that uses rough drawings and and sketches to tell a story, rather than a fully flushed out animation. Combined with music and the dramatic nature of the Dream SMP storylines, these videos were a great way to showcase the characters and their personalities, quickly garnering tens millions of views. 12 out of 16 of SAD-ist's most viewed videos are about the Dream SMP or feature the characters. Animatics of the Dream SMP quickly caught on as other artists created their own videos, and soon enough, the Dream SMP's most dramatic moments had been recreated in animation.
